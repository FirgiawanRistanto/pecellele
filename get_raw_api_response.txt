Okay, the error is still "SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1". This means the server is sending *something* at the very beginning of its response that is not valid JSON.

We need to see exactly what that "something" is.

Please go back to your browser's Developer Tools (F12), go to the "Network" tab, and reload the admin page. Find the `/api/sliders` request.

This time, please go to the **"Response" tab** (or "Preview" tab) for that request and **copy and paste the entire raw content** that you see there. This will show us precisely what the server is returning.

Do not just describe it; copy and paste the full text. This is critical to finding the root cause.
