Okay, I need you to check the browser's developer console (F12) and network tab for the `/api/sliders` request. Please tell me:
1.  The HTTP Status Code for the `/api/sliders` request.
2.  The exact response content from the `/api/sliders` request.
3.  Any errors in the Console tab related to slider data or the `getSliders` function.
