I have added the CSRF meta tag to `home.blade.php`. This should fix the issue with the "Kirim Pesanan" button being unclickable.

Please refresh your **home page** in the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) and try making an order again:

1.  Add items to your cart.
2.  Select "Transfer Dana" as the payment method.
3.  **Upload an image file** for payment proof.
4.  Fill in other details (address, notes).
5.  Submit the order.

Let me know if the order goes through successfully now, or if you encounter a different error.
