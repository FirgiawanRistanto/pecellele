Okay, the database migration to add `payment_proof_image` column has been successfully applied, and the `OrderController` is configured to handle the image upload.

Please refresh your **home page** in the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) and try making an order:

1.  Add items to your cart.
2.  Select "Transfer Dana" as the payment method.
3.  Verify that the "Unggah Bukti Pembayaran" (Upload Payment Proof) field appears.
4.  **Upload an image file** as payment proof.
5.  Fill in other details (address, notes).
6.  Submit the order.

Let me know if the order goes through successfully and if you still see any errors. We are testing if the entire process (frontend upload, backend saving) works.
