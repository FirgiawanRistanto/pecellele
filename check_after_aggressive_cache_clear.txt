I have performed a full, aggressive clear and rebuild of all caches and the Composer autoloader. This should resolve any lingering issues related to class loading.

Please refresh your admin page in the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) and check if the "Target class [App\Http\Controllers\Api\SliderController] does not exist" error is finally resolved and if the slider data is now loading correctly.
