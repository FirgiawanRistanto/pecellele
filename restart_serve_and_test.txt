I have cleared the route cache again.

Now, please perform the following steps carefully:

1.  **Stop `php artisan serve`:** If you have `php artisan serve` running in your terminal, please stop it (usually by pressing `Ctrl+C`).
2.  **Restart `php artisan serve`:** Start the development server again by running `php artisan serve` in your terminal.
3.  **Refresh Admin Page:** Go to your browser, refresh the admin page (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`).
4.  **Test "Export to PDF":** Try clicking the "Export to PDF" button again.

Please let me know if the PDF now downloads or if you get a different error.
