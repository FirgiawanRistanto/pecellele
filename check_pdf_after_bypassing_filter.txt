I have temporarily modified the PDF generation to always include ALL sales data, bypassing the filtering logic. This is to determine if the PDF rendering itself is working.

Please refresh your admin page in the browser (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R) and try generating the PDF report again.

*   **If the PDF now shows all sales data:** This means the PDF rendering works, and the problem is specifically with the date filtering logic in the controller.
*   **If the PDF is still empty:** This means the problem might be in the `resources/views/pdf/report.blade.php` file or how dompdf is processing it.

Let me know the result!
