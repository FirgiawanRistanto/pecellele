Okay, since the slider data is present in the database, the problem is definitely on the frontend side, specifically in how `public/js/admin.js` is trying to fetch or process that data.

To debug this, please do the following in your web browser:

1.  **Open Developer Tools:** Press `F12` (or right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect").
2.  **Go to the "Network" tab:** This tab shows all network requests made by the browser.
3.  **Reload the Admin Page:** While the Developer Tools are open, reload the admin page (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`).
4.  **Find the `/api/sliders` request:** Look for an entry in the Network tab that corresponds to `/api/sliders` (it should be a `GET` request).
5.  **Inspect the request:** Click on the `/api/sliders` request.
6.  **Report the following:**
    *   **Status Code:** What is the HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 404, 500)?
    *   **Response Tab:** Go to the "Response" sub-tab and copy/paste the exact content that the server returned.
    *   **Console Tab:** Also, check the "Console" tab for any errors related to JavaScript or the slider loading. Copy/paste any relevant errors.

This information will help me understand why the frontend is failing to load the data.
