The error "Tidak dapat terhubung ke server untuk membuat pesanan" still indicates a problem during the communication between your browser (frontend) and the Laravel application (backend) when submitting the order.

Since the Laravel logs (`laravel.log`) are not showing any new errors related to the `OrderController` or `payment_proof_image` when you try to place an order, the error might be happening *before* Laravel can process the request or is a network-related issue.

To pinpoint the exact problem, we need to inspect the network request in your browser's developer tools very carefully.

Please follow these steps again, precisely, and copy/paste the full content requested:

1.  **Open Developer Tools:** Press `F12` (or right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect").
2.  **Go to the "Network" tab:** This tab shows all network requests made by the browser.
3.  **Clear Network Log:** Click the "Clear" button (usually a circle with a slash through it) to remove old requests.
4.  **Try to Place an Order:** Go back to your home page, add items, select "Transfer Dana", **upload an image file** for payment proof, fill in other details, and click "Kirim Pesanan".
5.  **Observe the `/api/orders` request:** In the Network tab, you should see a `POST` request to `/api/orders`. Click on it.
6.  **Report the following EXACTLY:**
    *   **Status Code:** What is the HTTP status code (e.g., 200, 400, 413, 500, or pending/failed)?
    *   **Response Tab Content:** Click on the "Response" sub-tab and **copy and paste the entire raw content** you see there. This is CRUCIAL. If it's empty, say so.
    *   **Headers Tab - Request Payload/Form Data:** Click on the "Headers" sub-tab, scroll down to "Request Payload" or "Form Data" section, and expand it. Take a screenshot or copy the key-value pairs to confirm that the `payment_proof_image` file is being sent.
    *   **Console Tab:** Also, check the "Console" tab for any new errors related to JavaScript or the order submission. Copy/paste any relevant errors.

This information is vital to understand *why* the connection is failing.
